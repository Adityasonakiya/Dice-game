# Dice-game
We will be building a Dice Game Project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Dice Game is based on a two-player. You need to refresh the page and the player who gets the highest phase value will win the game.

**HTML Code** : HTML code is used to design the basic structure of the project. The HTML code contains the initial dice phase naming Player1 and Player2 with a Title **Refresh Me** to roll the dices. 

**CSS Code** : In this section, we used some CSS property to style the Dice Game.

**JavaScript Code** : The JavaScript code contains the functionality of Dice Game. The first functionality is to generate random dice phases after refreshing the page.  After refreshing the page, anyone player will win who get the highest phase value. If both players get the same phase value then the game will draw.
